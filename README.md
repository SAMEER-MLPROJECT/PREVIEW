## Overview

CryptEthEra is a cybersecurity-oriented smart-grid monitoring framework designed to detect electricity theft, meter tampering, fraudulent reporting, and infrastructure anomalies in electrical distribution networks.

The framework combines:

* Blockchain-based immutable logging
* Graph-theoretic anomaly detection
* Machine Learning analytics
* IoT telemetry collection
* Cryptographic authentication
* Experimental physical-layer monitoring

to create a transparent, tamper-resistant, and scalable monitoring architecture.
